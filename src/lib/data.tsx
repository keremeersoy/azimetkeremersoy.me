        description: `In May 2023, I joined {0}, a dynamic 6-person startup, as a full-stack web developer. As the sole web developer on the team, I took on the challenge of creating a robust admin dashboard specifically designed for business owners.
  
        Utilizing a modern tech stack that includes {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, and {6}, I developed a comprehensive solution that allows business owners to efficiently manage their employees' statistics, tasks, shifts, feedback, and more. This dashboard streamlines administrative tasks, enhances overall functionality, and ensures a seamless user experience.

        At Pepteam, I also developed a superadmin dashboard for app administrators, enabling them to access and manage all users across the Pepteam app.

        Additionally, under Pepteam, a mobile application called {7} was developed. I contributed by creating an internal app management website, allowing for efficient content management within the application.`,
